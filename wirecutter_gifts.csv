Three-wheelers either have bicycle-style steering, with handlebars you turn to direct motion and two wheels in either the front or back, or a lean-to-steer build, with two wheels in the front and handlebars that are just for balance, not steering. Specialized types of scooters like off-road, trick, caster (powered by twisting your body with feet on the deck), and electric scooters may appeal to certain riders, but we opted to focus exclusively on simpler, nonmotorized models intended primarily for pavement for this guide. I drew on the experience of Wirecutter parents and conducted an informal survey on Facebook to help determine which scooters were the most popular in different types of environments, comparing small cities, urban areas, and rural neighborhoods. I also looked at the top sellers on Amazon and other retailers, reviewed recommendations from other sites, and came up with an initial list of 14 popular, highly rated scooters. Based on my research, we determined that a great scooter should: A height-adjustable steering column allows a scooter to grow with the child, and a wide-ranging weight limit allows riding for many years.  Strong, nonbreakable decks and sturdy rust-resistant materials help a scooter endure the hard wear that a kid will give it and last through multiple kids. It should ideally be easy to replace parts when they wear down.  Larger, 120 mm or 125 mm polyurethane wheels help riders glide over bumps and cracks in the road or sidewalk, while 98 mm wheels, or those made of plastic, will give a rougher ride. Larger wheels also help you go faster. Stability is enhanced by wider handlebarsÉ??keeping arms farther apart helps with balanceÉ??and wide decks, especially for new riders. Handlebars should be easy to turn, if required, and brakes should be easy to apply to slow down on hills. A lighter scooter can be easier for a toddler to use, since a pound can make a difference for a younger kid still figuring out how to steer. (And an older kid may find a lighter model less of a literal drag.)  Assembly for some models might be as minimal as inserting the T-bar into the deck, while others may require you to put many parts together with tools. Whatever is required, the directions should be clear, and the assembly straightforward. For our initial round of testing in 2018, we used the above criteria to narrow our initial list of 14 scooters down to seven models to test: I spent 16 hours evaluating these seven finalists together with my kid riders. To start, I timed the assembly of each scooter, noting any particular frustrations, as well as if extra tools were needed. I also weighed and measured each one to determine ease of storage and carrying. With my kids, I evaluated the scooters in everyday conditions, using each scooter for at least three neighborhood jaunts. After the first three trips, I eliminated one of the scooters that didnÉ??t perform well and kept using the remainder. I examined how the scooters turned, braked, and held together over different terrains, like grass or bumpy sidewalks. I recorded the scooters to compare their noiseÉ??less noise is an indicator of a smoother ride. I also arranged a testing panel at a park. A group of six kids, ranging in age from 1 to 10, navigated scooters around an obstacle course while we filmed and observed them. They also raced and attempted tricks on the scooters. In 2019, we tested two new scooters: the  , a folding version of our top pick, and the  . My kids, then 3 and 6, used these scooters on their .75-mile commute to school, swerved them on various surfaces in the park, and jumped on them at home to assess durability and quality. In late 2022, we identified and tested seven additional scooters, again with our original criteria in mind. These included two new scooters from Micro, the maker of our top picks, plus four additional models: We wanted to know how some of the newer scooters in the category rated against our long-term picks. Existing models also had newer featuresÉ??such as curved handlebars, LED wheels, and folding mechanismsÉ??that we wanted to test. Finally, we wanted to better evaluate how less-expensive scooters compared with our existing picks. Together with my kids, I spent 6 hours evaluating the new test group on sidewalks, streets, and grass around my neighborhood. I also had tweens and toddlers test the bunch, in addition to my own children who were 6 and 9 at the time of this testing.",,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-scooters/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-scooters/

Its high-quality build delivers a smooth, responsive ride and will hold up to years of use. May be out of stock This is the same scooter, with the added convenience of a handlebar that folds down for easy storage or portability and LED lights in the wheels, which help with visibility in the dark. Little kids may find it a bit tough to fold on their own, though. The   fits the widest age range of any scooter we tested. ItÉ??s stable enough to make younger riders feel confident, and itÉ??s agile enough to keep older riders engaged. A noticeably high-quality construction makes it perform betterÉ??and thus more enjoyablyÉ??than cheaper models and also makes it more durable. The scooter requires minimal setup and is reasonably convenient to store and haul around. The   offers the same build and performance as the Maxi Deluxe, but the T-bar handle folds down, which makes the scooter easier to carry or store. The Micro Maxi Deluxe is recommended for ages 5 to 12, but many kids can master it at 3 or 4. The Maxi DeluxeÉ??s handlebar extends from 24 inches up to 34 inches from the deck, which accommodates a rider who is 5-foot-3 at the upper limit (the recommended weight maximum is 110 pounds). MicroÉ??s scooters are safety certified by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, according to   set by ASTM International. The Micro Maxi Deluxe scooter is sturdy enough to hold up to many years of use. Its flexible fiberglass-reinforced deck flexes just the right amount: ItÉ??s not as rigid as the bigger Razor modelsÉ?? metal decks but doesnÉ??t bend in the middle like the cheaper plastic decks of the Razor Jr. LilÉ?? Kick or Den Haven scooters we tested. The Maxi Deluxe had the smoothest, quietest ride of the scooters we tested mostly due to the 120 mm polyurethane wheels in the front and that reinforced deck, which together absorb bumps in the sidewalk. The T-bar is made of rust-resistant aluminum and built to last. The deck has a nonslip coating, which helps with pushing off. To control their speed, riders push down on the brake over the rear wheels. Like its smaller cousin the Micro Mini Deluxe, the Maxi Deluxe was the most-stable and easiest scooter for newbies to learn on. In our tests, a 4-year-old with no prior scooter experience easily picked up riding this scooter. Tall 3-year-olds were equally able to ride this model with the handlebar on its lowest setting. In hours, our testers went from learning to balance to gracefully carving and surfing roadways on the Maxi Deluxe. The Maxi Deluxe comes in two pieces and took just minutes to set up out of the box. The Maxi Deluxe Foldable LED comes fully assembled. For both scooters, we followed the companyÉ??s recommendation to tighten the handlebar clamp to desired resistance using the supplied tool before using it. The Maxi Deluxe doesnÉ??t fold up, but since it stands on its own, itÉ??s easy to stash away at a school bike rack or in front of a house. It weighs 5.5 pounds (the same as the Razor A3, another model we like for older kids), about a pound heavier than the Micro Mini Deluxe,  . The folding version basically bends in half, and the handlebar lays flat against the kickboard. This makes it easy to toss in the bottom of a stroller, lug onto a bus, or stow in a car trunk or locker. The Maxi Deluxe is available in seven bright colors, while the folding version comes in four. Micro scooters come with a  , which is the most generous of any scooters we tested. To support the long-lived usability of its scooters, Micro sells   and provides   that show you how to make various repairs. Many online reviewers have noted that MicroÉ??s customer service and parts departments are very easy to work withÉ??which makes the scooters hold their value even longer. Without a handlebar that can rotate all the way around the deck, the Micro Maxi Deluxe isnÉ??t as much fun for tricks as two-wheel scooters. We have seen these scooters at the skate park, but riders will find it tougher to do advanced moves on them. If youÉ??re looking for a scooter for doing tricks, you may want to consider getting the   or a Jetson Jupiter. A couple of Amazon reviewers   that the handlebars   at heights between the minimum and maximum, but this issue is probably because they did not tighten the clamp with the included Allen key before using it, as instructed in the manual. Two other Amazon users   that the back wheels of their Maxi Deluxe scooters  , but Micro said this is due to heavy use of the brake, and that most kids should get one to two years of wear out of their wheels before needing to replace them. The hinge of the foldable version of the Maxi Deluxe is quite stiff, and it takes some strength to fold the handlebar down. My kindergartener is nowhere near being able to fold it himself, and some adults may even find it difficult: I have to brace the scooter against my body to get enough leverage to fold it. In our experience, it does loosen up and become easier to fold over time.",140,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-scooters/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-scooters/

The Micro Mini Deluxe is suggested for ages 2 to 5, though some kids can successfully master the developmental skills of pushing and steering even younger than that, and an 18-month-old we know was able to successfully ride this scooterÉ??and with so much joy. The Mini DeluxeÉ??s handlebar extends from 17 inches up to 25 inches; the Maxi DeluxeÉ??s starts at 24 inches. We found that many 5-year-olds are too tall for the scooterÉ??s maximum handlebar height; if youÉ??re buying a scooter for an older kid, consider the Micro Maxi Deluxe instead, as youÉ??ll get more years of use out of it. The Mini Deluxe can ferry riders up to 110 pounds, the same as the Maxi Deluxe. We did not test the popular   because its fixed-height handlebar limits its usable life more than the Mini DeluxeÉ??s adjustable one. The Mini Deluxe, like the Maxi Deluxe, has polyurethane wheels and a flexible fiberglass-reinforced deck, which give a smooth and quiet ride on various hard surfaces and absorb bumps in the sidewalk. The Mini DeluxeÉ??s deck is shorter and narrower than the Maxi DeluxeÉ??s, and the wheels are narrower, all of which make it lighter and more responsive to a smaller rider. It also has one wheel in the back compared with the Maxi DeluxeÉ??s two side-by-side wheels (which help heavier kids brake). Even though the Mini Deluxe is built for younger riders with its lower weight limit, smaller deck, and shorter handlebar, it can still move very quickly. Our 1- and 2-year-old testers were able to push off and cruise forward with ease, but they struggled consistently at the beginning to turn and stopÉ??a factor of their developmentÉ??so parental involvement is needed at the start of the learning process. Most kids stop by putting feet down or bailing into bushes before learning to brake, reviewers  . The Micro Mini Deluxe scooter has a  , just like the Maxi DeluxeÉ??and the folding mechanism was a little easier to handle during testing, as it has a smaller lever that requires less force to adjust. Folding makes it easy to tote onto a subway or busÉ??or even put into a suitcase for use on a trip. ItÉ??s the lightest scooter we tested, weighing just 4.2 pounds. That makes it easy for a toddler to maneuver, especially if theyÉ??re still learning how to steer, and it also makes the scooter easy for a parent to carry in one hand while football-carrying a screaming 2-year-old in the other. Reviewers noted the Micro Mini DeluxeÉ??s ability to help kids gain confidence in the basics of scootering. É??My grandson rips on this,É?ù   an Amazon reviewer.

Some review sites suggest that, given the relatively short window that a child may use the Micro Mini Deluxe, itÉ??s   to buy the most-basic Mini model without the adjusting-height handlebar (the adjustable handlebar is the main feature of the Mini Deluxe). We prefer the adjustable-height version because the price difference is only about $10, and the 8 inches of adjustability allows a child to use the scooter for an extra year or twoÉ??or let a smaller friend play with it.

Make sure the card states É??No Fees After Purchase.É?ù Most cards sold at grocery stores and places like Walmart, Target, and Amazon fit this bill, but those sold through banks sometimes have unexpected fees.

The   from this Pittsburgh-based studio make the perfect vessel for holding a succulent or a candle. Ray and Val Talbert, the husband-and-wife duo who run the studio, ethically source minerals. And together with their small team, they carefully arrange the stones over hand-cast concrete to create a faux-geode look. Edged in gold, these planters are uniquely beautiful pieces that any mom will love. This 20-inch square of cotton is a traditional Japanese furoshiki wrapping cloth; it also makes a fine tea towel, hanky, or gift bundle. In this  , cats celebrate the summer holiday of Tanabata, tying their wishes to a tree in hopes that they come true. If you were wishing for a cute gift idea, yours has just come true. Furoshiki are traditional Japanese wrapping cloths, and the mom on your gift list can use one for anything, whether as a tea towel, a handkerchief, or gift wrap. Staffers have bought other cotton furoshiki from the woman-owned Umami Mart and shared that they have a nice, tight weave and hold up well against washes.",21,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-cheap-mothers-day-gifts/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-cheap-mothers-day-gifts/

Whether your mom needs somewhere to set her keys and sunglasses or to create a beautiful still life of precious objects,   from Hay will do the trick. TheyÉ??re made of scratch-resistant, powder-coated steel and come in 15 mix-and-match colors and five sizes. The extra-small diamond shape is about $20 and great for small doo-dads like AirPods or loose change, the hexagonal small size is a great single-serve snack tray and the broadest, largest stray makes a useful indoor/outdoor carryall. Worth-the-price goatskin gloves that protect hands and wrists from briars and brambles.

The material will stretch and mold to momÉ??s hands after she uses them for a while, making them fit like, well, a glove. They arrive white, and even though she can clean them simply by wearing them to wash up, they do brown with age. If sheÉ??s the more practical type, a pair from our   has a handful of great options. The L.L.Bean Boat and Tote is made from heavy canvas that will last a lifetime. It comes in four sizes, with a variety of handle-length and color options, but it doesnÉ??t have any pockets for storage. The   is a classic for a reason; it lasts forever, and the design is infinitely malleable (preppy to boho, maybe not punk). The mom on your list can use it to carry everything (keys, wallet, firewood), depending on the size. Staff writer Samantha Schoech has been using and abusing her extra-large tote through 16 years of raising twins, and itÉ??s still going strong. Caveat: They do get dirty, and although you can throw them in the washing machine, the thick, rigid canvas will never be pristine again. Of course, thatÉ??s part of the charm. A flexible silicone reading light that is secure, holds a charge for up to 60 hours, and stores flat like a bookmark. If your mom still reads paper books and shares a bed with someone else, she needs a personal reading light. Staff writer and avid reader Samantha Schoech swears by these   for nighttime reading (and spousal harmony) after lights out. The Mighty Bright Recharge Light clips tightly to the cover or a chunk of pages and bends to brightly illuminate the page. When youÉ??re done, it flattens enough to be used as a bookmark. A charge lasts up to 60 hours and because it clips, it can be used as a mini task light as well.

Not only did our   find the flavors bright, clean, and thoroughly enjoyable, but they thought roughly $35 for 80 servings of high-quality teaÉ??not to mention extremely elegant, reusable packagingÉ??was an excellent value. If your mom prefers her tea loose, Harney & Sons makes   of those as well. DonÉ??t let the chaotic Etsy shop deter you. The generous cut and even more generous array of prints and colors means this lightweight kaftan suits nearly every body and style. Gifting clothing is a risky proposition, but this isnÉ??t exactly clothing. ItÉ??s more like a cute and wearable soft breeze. The construction of this   is relatively straightforward: a rectangle of cotton with a reinforced v-neck, drawstring waist, kimono-like sleeves, and subtle side slits. But the kaftanÉ??s versatility is definitely not basic. Staff writer Samantha Schoech wears hers most often as a housedress, but it also comes in handy as a beach cover-up, nightgown, or even a sundress. She suggests the longer, ankle-length version, although it comes knee-length, too. ItÉ??s also available in more than 400 prints and patterns plus style variations like side ties or front buttons. This outdoorsy-looking dopp kit packs down flat but is still roomy when expanded. It does, however, lack pockets and a hook. If mom has some travel on the horizon, make it easy for her to tote all of her bathroom essentials with one of our favorite dopp kits from  . It has space to hold all the usual gear like toothpaste, floss, and sunscreen, but its unique prism shape and color-blocked design guarantees that no one else mistakes it for theirs.

DonÉ??t be fooledÉ??this cute enameled vessel with its chubby wooden handle isnÉ??t just for butter. It also works as a small stovetop pot, a bowl for soup or hot cocoa, or as a ladle or scoop. *At the time of publishing, the price was  $45 . At first glance a butter warmer may seem like a bizarre gift (like, I thought my microwave was already a butter warmer). But donÉ??t be misled by the name: This   does much more than melt butter. The 16-ounce enameled steel body also makes it great for small tasks like heating up soup for one or warming hot chocolate. And the cute wooden handle is easy to grab, making it perfect for ladling. This sweet little vessel is a gift that keeps on giving, and your mother will find endless uses for it. These whimsical leather characters readily perk up everyday accessories such as purses and key chains. A brand-new purse is a pricey gift, and realistically, the mom in your life may already be carrying one that she likes. Instead, we love the idea of giving her a little keychain to make that purse feel like new. In addition to the  , Min & Mon has several other  , including  . The keychains are great to use functionally (like, for keys), but we hope your mom chooses to strap them to the side of her purse so the whole world knows how cool she is. An all-purpose, all-natural oil that readily hydrates hair, body, face, and nails, sans any greasy residue. We like the botanical fragrance, but it comes in an unscented version, too. Your mom has probably already told you this, but the secret to aging gracefully is money (sorry) and moisturizing. So give her some of that. This neutral blend of coconut, jojoba, castor, and argan oil is scented with light and lovely essential oils like palo santo and geranium, and our staffers have been drenching themselves in it for years. It hydrates without feeling heavy or greasy, and its warm, slightly sweet, beguiling scent lingers but doesnÉ??t call too much attention to itself (an   is also available). The simple, minimally adorned bottle is attractive enough to leave out next to the sink or tub. But if your mom wants to keep it all for herself, we endorse that, too. Though the smaller sizes cost under $25 and the 8-oz bottle shatters our price ceiling at about $52, the larger size is the better value. This 120-page retrospective features full-color prints of Impressionist painter Mary CassattÉ??s tender portraits of mothers and children. Mary Cassatt made her career painting two classes of people rarely highlighted during the late 19th century: mothers and their children. Cassatt was one of few female painters in the Impressionist circle of Paris. And her oil paintings and pastels reveal her access to the most intimate moments of those she depicted, glorious in their mundanity: a woman bathing her baby, two children playing on the floor, a mother breastfeeding. This   collects the very best of CassattÉ??s works, with supplementary essays to help the mother in your life appreciate them to the fullest. This little coffee press that could is easy to use, clean, and take on the go. It might not be the prettiest press out there, but it makes a truly good cup of joe. For the coffee-loving mom who travels often or works outside the home, the   makes a great gift. ItÉ??s as speedy as a Nespresso machine and as straightforward as a French press. And the coffee it makes tastes nearly as good as that made in a pour-over. WhatÉ??s more, it comes in a portable package that travels easily wherever your mom goes. This tough, spill-proof blanket isnÉ??t the cushiest for lounging, but it is the easiest to keep clean, and it folds small for easy transportation. Give mom the gift of easy outdoor hangs with one of   by  . ItÉ??s big enough to fit four seated adults, but it was the smallest of all of our picks when folded up, making it perfectly portable.

Just add sandwiches,  , and a few bottles of something festive, and sheÉ??ll have the perfect dining experience. Eight different spices including Indian turmeric, Vietnamese cinnamon, and Greek oregano come in this affordable gift pack along with recipe cards for ideas on how to use each one. If the mom youÉ??re shopping for likes to cook, sheÉ??ll get great use out of this  , which is also one of our favorite budget-friendly  . Curio Spice Company toasts or grinds many of its spices in-house and sources them from small, sustainable farms around the world, making for more vibrant and nuanced flavors.

This ValentineÉ??s DayÉ??themed box contains the exact same assortment as the Black Box. The only difference is the packaging.  Adventurous chocolate lovers and traditionalists alikeÉ??those who will appreciate creative riffs on a classic chocolate selection.  Unlike many of the chocolate boxes weÉ??ve tried, the 16-piece   offers a full sensory experienceÉ??which is part of the reason for giving boxed chocolates in the first place. Every piece is memorable. Classic concoctions, such as Burnt Caramel and Piedmont Hazelnut, offer just the right balance of sweet and bitter. Adventurous flavors, like Tarragon Grapefruit or Star Anise & Pink Peppercorn, are never overpowering (a problem weÉ??ve encountered with most other flavored chocolates). One of our favorites, the Sesame Nougat, has the perfect texture of chewy caramel, a little crunch from toasted sesame seeds, and the snap of perfectly tempered dark chocolate. We found the chocolate itself to be of high quality, with the subtle, long flavor that comes from great cacao. The bonbons arenÉ??t too sweet, either. ThereÉ??s just enough sugar to balance out the flavors. Among all of the chocolates we tested, the Recchiuti bonbons come in the most intriguing shapes and designs. No two chocolates are alike. Some have intricate patterns, while others look like little sculptures. As they say, you eat with your eyes first, and the visual variety adds excitement to this experience. To top it off, the Recchiuti packagingÉ??a matte black box thatÉ??s sexy, without being excessive or too obviousÉ??is among the most elegant we encountered in our testing. (If this box doesnÉ??t appeal to you, Recchiuti sometimes offers seasonal versions with different packaging. For ValentineÉ??s Day 2023, thereÉ??s a   box thatÉ??s silver with a red ribbon.) The Recchiuti box includes a minimally designed booklet explaining the flavors, with black-and-white illustrations of each chocolate.

Quite often, the style outshines the substance, as we experienced when tasting the chocolates from   and  . ThatÉ??s not the case with the  . The colorful hemispheres are so shiny that you can practically see your reflection in them (one taster dubbed them É??space marblesÉ?ù). But unlike the other chocolates we sampled in this style (which tended to have thick coatings and fillings that didnÉ??t match the exterior dazzle), Melissa Coppel chocolates have whisper-thin skins that give way to meticulously conceived fillings. One chocolate encases peanut butter ganache, a dab of raspberry jelly, and a crouton of brioche toast. Another conceals three equidistant dots of raspberry rose jelly suspended in a silky yogurt ganache. ItÉ??s worth slicing into the chocolates to see the cross sections, which are shockingly neat and composed. The flavors are balanced and intense, and they come in dynamic waves. (ItÉ??s no surprise that Melissa Coppel comes from a fine-pastry background, with experience at restaurants such as LÉ??Atelier de Jo?Æl Robuchon.) The box also includes a selection of more-traditional, square-shaped dipped chocolates. Though the styles are vastly different, the execution is no less precise and the flavors no less saturated. A crunchy gianduja chocolate was, in the words of one tester, a perfect praline. Another favorite evoked the Mediterranean with pistachio lemon ganache and marzipan. Like the chocolates, the box is an ombre galaxy of colorsÉ??an object of art unto itself. (One taster said sheÉ??d keep it long after the chocolates were gone.) The bonbons are carefully packed under a clear plastic shell, which protects each one during transit. Although the box doesnÉ??t include a pamphlet listing the flavors, Melissa Coppel does one better: When you pick up a chocolate, the flavor is written in the vacant space.

Food enthusiasts who would enjoy exploring a wide array of flavors or tasting the nuances of different single-origin chocolates side by side.  As the name suggests, the   box is intended as an introduction to the universe of flavors and techniques in the French chocolate makerÉ??s arsenal. Each box contains 16 miniature chocolates and 16 thin chocolate squares (called É??ultra-finesÉ?ù), packed in separate layers. As tiny and delicate as the chocolates are, they arenÉ??t meant to be wolfed down. The precision of the fillingsÉ?? flavors and the complexity of the single-origin wafers both demand appreciation. This is the perfect gift for someone who enjoys guessing the ingredients in whatever theyÉ??re eating and someone who finds taste to be a fun game of discovery. The quirky packaging enhances that sense of wonder. Each level of the two-tiered box pulls out like a drawer, revealing a mosaic of neatly arranged chocolates. The top layer holds a tidy grid of diminutive one-bite bonbons, adorned with colorful patterns that (with the help of a legend) tell you whatÉ??s inside. The bottom layer contains a quadrant of glossy chocolate tiles. These tiles have a pleasing snap when you bite into them, releasing waves of flavor as they melt on your tongue. (The tiles donÉ??t require a flavor key: The cacao content and the beansÉ?? origins are É??printedÉ?ù on each tile in an eye-catching graphic, with tasting notes on the reverse side,  .) The Richart Initiation box is a true sampler, and the filled chocolates represent the following diverse categories: fruity, citrus, floral, herbal, spicy, roasted (including caramels and pralines), and balsam (ganaches that are single-origin or flavored with botanicals like vanilla and tonka bean). What struck us was how true the promised flavors were and how much punch was packed into each bite. É??What kind of sorcery do they use to get such outsize fruit flavor into their fruit ganaches?É?ù asked supervising editor Marilyn Ong, who observed that the raspberry ganache chocolate tasted É??like 10 raspberries diedÉ?ù to make just one bonbon. That excellence was consistent across flavor categories. The citrusy yuzu caramel coulis was intensely fragrant, the filling fresh and runny. The thyme-praline (made with hazelnuts) was an unlikely yet balanced combination, with flavors that were both fully expressed and harmonious. Though the Richart Initiation box contains a rainbow of flavors, the chocolates themselves are practically identical in appearance. For someone who enjoys a variety of sizes and styles yet still craves a thrilling gastronomic experience, the   chocolates would be a better choice.  Compared with the coatings on some other chocolates we tasted, the Richart bonbonsÉ?? coating was a bit thick in ratio to the filling. But the filling flavors are so intense that they still shine through. For some people, the intensity of the flavors may be overwhelming, especially if the chocolates are eaten in quick succession. This pick probably isnÉ??t for someone with a more conservative palate. Also, the Richart Initiation box is precious but petite. If you wish to upgrade to a larger version, the next size up contains 49 filled chocolates and 36 squares and is more than double the price. What this box lacks in heft, however, it makes up for in pleasure. Finally, at about $180 a pound, these chocolates are the most expensive of our picks, and even more so when you factor in the additional cost of shipping directly from France (unless you spend $90 or more, in which case shipping is free). But we think the vibrancy of these chocolates makes them a worthy splurge for a special occasion.  16 filled chocolates, plus 16 dark and milk chocolate wafers  4.68 ounces  Richart ships from France to the US and Canada.

Our panelists found the chocolates to be true to their descriptions, sometimes uncannily so. The Maya Mountain, Belize truffle was indeed bright and fruity, with prominent strawberry flavor. And it was entirely unlike the Ambanja, Madagascar truffle, which sang with the promised essence of pineapple.

ThereÉ??s not a lot of variety in shape or texture to these bonbons, but the box does include four pieces each of four different, satisfying flavors: Caffe, Frutta, Maple, and Sel. The Caffe had a strong taste of coffee; the Frutta contained pieces of dried fruit; the Maple tinged that chocolate a bit sweeter; and the Sel was sprinkled with the perfect amount of sea salt (great for those who like a salty-sweet combo). Each chocolate was expertly layered, with a ganache center, crisped brown rice, and either dried fruit or flavored caramel. And all were enrobed in a nice, thin layer of dark chocolate.

The cost isn't cheap, but the reliable and intuitive website allows the most customization around price, delivery speed, and aesthetics. Use code WIRECUTTER, includes $10 shipping Every aspect of   experience was a pleasure, but what cinched our recommendation was the fresh, eye-popping array of lush blooms that lasted longer than any other bouquet we received. The   bouquet we ordered included ten densely layered roses with nary a frayed petal, a handful of widespread orange gerbera daisies, and delicately ruffled carnations. Rather than relying on wispy or nondescript filler like babyÉ??s breath, stock, or leatherleaf fern, The Bouqs Company arrangement was finished with long-lasting, textural stems like green hypericum berries, yellow craspedia baubles, and just a few glossy leaves. ThereÉ??s also the matter of aesthetics, which of course is subjective. We found many other sites, even good ones, opted for arrangements centered around widely available staples like daylilies, sunflowers, and alstroemeria. Of course, nothing is inherently wrong with any of those flowers. But all of the offerings from The Bouqs CompanyÉ??with the exception of same-day options, which weÉ??ll get to belowÉ??are edited with a careful, pleasing eye. Looking beyond the   bouquet,   feature tulips and antique carnations or spray roses and ranunculus. And even when more-ubiquitous flowers are used, theyÉ??re selected in rare colors or grouped in unexpected pairings, offering a considered and expensive-feeling appeal. The Bouqs CompanyÉ??s website is more modern, accurate, and customizable than any other service we tested. For starters, it offers a dropdown menu for delivery speedÉ??no rush, next day, or same dayÉ??a remarkable and significant point of difference from any of our other top contenders. Even more notable, though, is that The Bouqs Company ships to all 50 states, and all of those delivery speeds were actually available in the varied locations we checked, which is rare in national flower delivery companies.  , for instance, partners with Instacart to highlight a same-day delivery option, but it wasnÉ??t consistently available (or at all) for some addresses. The Bouqs Company also had helpful and intuitive filtering at every step of the process, which allows shoppers to view options by price, flower, occasion, or color combinations at multiple stages. Vases arenÉ??t included in the base price, but you can add one of three simple, tasteful options, including a Mason jar, for $10 to $15. Most of the arrangements from The Bouqs Company are available in a range of three sizes; the smallest and most-affordable selections start around $50 before shipping fees are added. We ordered the Deluxe size of the  , a midsize arrangement that the website indicated was the most popular. The resulting 24-stem selection arrived in a single box, snugly split into two generous bouquets. Each individual bundle was so breathtakingly impressive, though, that we actually thought a mistake had been made in shipping and that weÉ??d gotten two bouquets instead of one. The incredible longevity of the flowers was notable. After a full seven days of enjoying them, we stopped tracking, removing a passed stem here and there to keep things fresh for even longer. The bouquet we received looked almost exactly like the pictures on the website, if not even more vibrant and opulently sized in person. True, some of the shopper bouquets under the #bouqlove carousel on the   landing page are courtesy of clearly marked #bouqspartners, but a look at the un-curated hashtag on Instagram features more of the same, so we trust that most shoppers had similarly great deliveries. Arrangements are big, colorful, and long-lasting and loaded with lovely, unique blooms, not common grocery-store stems. While offering same-day delivery options is a plus, the descriptions for those bouquets were more vague: É??blooms in pink, red, and hot pinkÉ?ù for instance, rather than a specific dossier of floral names. ThatÉ??s by design and very common on competitorsÉ?? sites for most arrangements. Ultimately, though, we welcomed the transparency. The Bouqs CompanyÉ??s same-day options are fulfilled and arranged by local florists, so they canÉ??t vouch for the variety of available buds and blooms. And if you are looking for a nearly immediate but more predictable array, the next-day options feature The Bouqs CompanyÉ??s standard arrangements and guaranteed composition. Another fact to consider is that the initial prices you see on The Bouqs Company arrangements donÉ??t represent the final total. Shipping runs anywhere from $15 to $25, which is significant but also fairly standard among services we tested. A few factors can mitigate that price: By creating a login, you can knock $15 off the delivery fee. Also, considering the luxurious size of our arrangement, the smaller 12-stem Original size for $54 would spark just as much joy.", ,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/

Importantly, the price is among the most affordable we found, and ordering is straightforward. The   floral offerings arenÉ??t as stylish as others we tried, but theyÉ??re fresh, pretty, and since delivery is free, about 30% cheaper than most. This service came recommended to us by several Wirecutter staffers whoÉ??ve sent them to their own loved ones. The page that lists the available arrangements is about as stylish as the rest of CostcoÉ??s website (which is to say, not at all), but itÉ??s easy enough to navigate: From the main Floral page you can click on categories such as Roses, Bouquets, Vase Arrangements, Occasions, and so forth. And from there you can filter for price, color, flower type, and delivery preference. The bouquet and vase arrangements Costco offers arenÉ??t as modern as those offered by Teleflora and The Bouqs Company, but they are pretty in a traditional way. And most of them cost far less than whatÉ??s offered at those other services. If youÉ??re a Costco member, you can avoid the 5% nonmember surcharge, and shipping is included so the only extra fee before checkout is the tax. Costco ships its flowers via different carriers, depending on location, and it does not offer weekend delivery Saturday through Monday. Opening the cardboard box revealed the glass vase and bouquet secured in plastic wrap and zip ties, plus instructions on trimming the stems, plant food, and wateringÉ??perhaps not the festive experience of unwrapping a present (?ˇ la our top pick), but still satisfying. When we ordered Costco flowers to both coasts in late 2022, two different orders were canceled with no explanation, although the quality of the blooms we ultimately received was up to standard. We didnÉ??t notice any chatter on social media about similar experiences, so we suspect it was a one-off, but weÉ??ll keep an eye on this issue. We ordered the   and the   floral arrangements, each of which cost about $50 and included vases. The 5% nonmember surcharge and the tax added about $7 to the order. The Get Well Wishes bouquet itself was beautiful but looked nearly nothing like its photo on the site. Where that photo has orange roses, yellow lilies, and purple daisies, the bouquet we received had light pink roses, yellow daisies, small purple flowers, orange lilies, tiny yellow sprigs, and green leafy filler. The bouquet lasted about five days before wilting. The vase that came with the   arrangement was enormous and laughably out of scale, and you canÉ??t swap it out for another size. Of course, that didnÉ??t affect the quality of the flowers, and popping them into an existing vase solves the issue for pickier recipients. The red vase that came with the   bouquet was decent-quality glass. The included É??Get Well SoonÉ?ù balloon was apple-size and sat atop a plastic stick that was shoved into the bouquetÉ??it was silly-looking but cheery, and we appreciated the option to include it.",Costco,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/

Unlike our other picks, Teleflora pulls from a network of local florists so it can deliver same-day.  uses local florists to fulfill flower orders, but unlike   (one of the other services we tested that works exclusively with local shops), it does not allow you to select the supplying florist when ordering, and the photos of the arrangements are supplied by Teleflora, not the individual florist. Still, thanks to that model, Teleflora is able to deliver arrangements the same day you order them, by handÉ??something not many companies can accomplish. TelefloraÉ??s site isnÉ??t as streamlined or sophisticated as The Bouqs CompanyÉ??s, but it was still easy to navigate: You can search by occasion, color, or flower type. Many of the arrangements are very pretty, though their names may make you laugh while ordering (some favorites of ours include: the   bouquet of 24 lavender roses and the   arrangement, which comes in a yellow, chick-theme vase). We ordered the standard-size   bouquet for about $50 from TelefloraÉ??s Just Because section and the standard-size   bouquet for about $65, and both arrangements were just as beautiful as those pictured on the site. Still, Teleflora had upfront pricing that was somewhat misleading: A $65 bouquet ended up costing about $86 after adding taxes and fees. Every rose, lily, and carnation was blemish free and fully blooming, and the eucalyptus and lemon leaf fillers offered beautiful contrast and additional scent. In our first round of testing, they came hand-delivered from a representative of the local florist that had fulfilled the order, who made us sign a receipt. (Since the Brooklyn apartment we sent the bouquet to has been subject to a fair amount of package theft recently, we were appreciative of this face-to-face handoff.) The glass vase that the bouquet came in was pretty enough that we kept it for future flowers. In the days leading up to ValentineÉ??s Day 2021, one staffer had a one-off experience in which an order missed the delivery date with no notification from Teleflora. He did receive prompt customer service and a full refund, and the flowers showed up a day later. Ultimately, this isnÉ??t a knock on Teleflora, but itÉ??s something to keep in mind on any flower-focused holiday. In 2022, the Citrus Kissed bouquet that our Portland, MaineÉ??based staffer received came via the best and fanciest florist in town, and it looked downright expensive, swapping babyÉ??s breath for drapey fronds and adding in pert tulips and chrysanthemums. It was a vote of confidence in favor of the network of trusted, upscale vendors Teleflora uses in less-familiar cities. This service also allows you to send flowers to a Canadian address, something we didnÉ??t see often during our research. Teleflora offers the option of including a 180-character message, and it came typed on a small, cute card inserted on a plastic, fork-like spoke. Perhaps because they arrived by hand, arranged in their vase rather than packaged for shipping, the flowers looked vibrant for a full week. They kept their amazing smell, too. Since Teleflora uses local florists, your experience may vary depending on the shop that puts your bouquet together, but our experiences were nothing but positive.

WeÉ??d had recent great experiences with both   and   bouquets, and we were equally impressed by their quality and beauty. We also gave points for an elegant website, straightforward pricing with no added fees, and accurate delivery times. But when we went to retest in December 2022, we had a different experience. For no discernible reason,  , a lovely collection of muted peach-tone roses, was not available to ship to Los Angeles. All of the ten roses that made it to Portland, Maine had brownish edges or a few flopping petals, and the fillerÉ??drooping lavender springs, a few branches of eucalyptus, and large green leaves with an odd white-ish castÉ??was less than inspired. To be sure the issue wasnÉ??t just with sourcing flowers in a specific bouquet, we ordered   in early 2023, which arrived on-time to New York, Los Angeles, and Portland.

The   arrangement we ordered looked beautiful, and the blooms were fresher than those in many others we tested. The bouquet came with three large, perky daisies, plus a good assortment of interesting filler (including fragrant eucalyptus) and a vase, all for about $43.

When we first published this piece, Benchmark Bouquets offered two-day delivery with Amazon Prime and shipped across the country. In 2020 we discovered that most arrangements were no longer available through Amazon Prime, and even when they were, the listed shipping time was several days. Many arrangements were unavailable to send to any address across the country that we input. At the time, a Benchmark Bouquets representative told us the company was experiencing issues with both shipping and stock, so we removed it as our pick. In December 2022, we scored one for about $45 all-inÉ??an exceptional price. The flowers looked exactly like the picture: fresh, garish, and a touch random, perched in a huge, curvaceous vase. WeÉ??ll keep an eye on this service to see if they can maintain consistency. Several companies fulfill their orders using local florists, but as far as we could find,   is the only one that lets you pick which florist youÉ??d like to use, along with photos supplied by the actual florist creating the arrangement. We ordered the   bouquet (about $65), which looked very similar to its supplied photo (the lilies looked slightly different, as was the color of the wooden vase). The arrangement was basic but very beautiful, featuring fully open blooms that were not crushed or torn. That beauty didnÉ??t last quite as long as with other bouquets we tried, though; within about four days blooms started to wilt and wither at the edges. Additionally, the price for the bouquet was not as clear upfront as others: After a $15 delivery fee (the companyÉ??s equivalent of a shipping fee), a $5 service fee, and $7 in taxes, the price ended up being about $92. (The delivery fee has since increased to $20.) Still, if you need a floral arrangement sent quickly, this is one of the few that offers same-day hand delivery, plus a complimentary note of up to 180 characters (and a teddy bear or box of Godiva chocolates for an additional fee). The   bouquet we received from   (which partners with local florists to source flowers) was beautiful, but some of the lilies in our arrangement were slightly damaged. The leatherleaf fern filler also wasnÉ??t as attractive as the filler in the UrbanStems and Benchmark Bouquets arrangements. Everything about our  ?ˇbouquet (no longer available) from   felt dated and boring. The website was a turnoff. And though our arrangement was pretty enough, it wasnÉ??t as interesting as those from any of our picks. Also, it barely resembled the listing online. (To the companyÉ??s credit, however, the blooms still looked like new a week after delivery.) For just over $100 (including $25 shipping), Farmgirl FlowersÉ??s   was disappointingÉ??even when we retested them in our 2022 testing. Not only was this nearly double what we paid for some other flowers we tested and preferred, but many of the blooms arrived looking tired and brown. This bouquet was delivered on a Friday, and the flowers barely survived the weekendÉ??we had to throw them out four days later. Our staffers loved the stylish idea of the burlap-wrapped bouquets, but with a pricy shipping fee and uninspired arrangements, we canÉ??t recommend them.",,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-online-flower-delivery/

Although there's the option to subscribe, we specifically recommend the one-month option, which allows you to order just the Seasons of Japan box.  Filled with an array of individually wrapped snacks from Japan in a multitude of flavors,   is simply delightful. Both the colorfully illustrated wrappers and the bites inside are dazzling. Each snack is thoughtfully chosen, and a booklet explains where each item comes from, its significance, and potential allergens. A note on ordering: Although thereÉ??s an option to choose a gift box subscription, which sends the recipient a different box each month, placing a one-month order gets you just the Seasons of Japan box we recommend. This is the only buying option that comes with free shipping, an e-gift message, and does not include a receipt. If you purchase a subscription in February or March, the Sakura box, a selection of snacks from Kyoto inspired by cherry-blossom season, replaces the Seasons of Japan box. The box includes a fun array of snacks that mostly skew sweet. Some items that were popular with our tasters include tender matcha-powdered mochi, crisp senbei (rice crackers) encrusted with sugar, and strawberry shortcake gummies shaped like slices of cake. The   box has 22 snacks, which felt like enough to last one person one to two weeks or to tide over several people for a few days. So many of the treats wowed us. The flavors of the crackers, puffs, and candies inside were alternately zingy, tart, sweet, and salty. Textures ranged from crispy to chewy to melt-in-your-mouth cotton-candy wispy. We loved the snappy Edamame Senbei, a salty-sweet cracker dusted with soybean powder. The Seaweed Tempura Setouchi Sudachi, a mind-blowing citrusy, salty, and earthy morsel, is composed of crisped rice clusters that look like barnacles glued to small squares of seaweed. The surreal White Strawberry is freeze-dried and then injected with white chocolate to dial up the sweetness of the fruit. The Funwari Meijin Mochi PuffsÉ??nutty, buttery, soybean-powder-coated rice cloudsÉ??dissolved on our tongues.

Overall, this basket has something for many palates.

One taste tester went so far as to call the Vermonter basket É??a true superstar,É?ù and we agree. Compared with other cheese baskets we tried, the Vermonter offered the best blend of complex and down-to-earth flavors. We loved the creamy, spruce-bark-wrapped Harbison, a luscious, slightly grassy   that evokes mushrooms and the forest floor. The Cabot Clothbound cheddar was a crowd favoriteÉ??even the pickiest eaters were fans. ItÉ??s salty and a bit tangy, with subtle notes of caramel. WeÉ??ve seen the third cheese vary, but the default is often Alpha Tolman, a raw-milk mountain-style cheese similar to a French raclette (we tried a different cheese in our tests but trust the quality of Jasper HillÉ??s offerings). The basket also comes with crackers (which you can swap for a gluten-free option at no extra charge) and a small sack of spiced pecans. There is an option to include a bottle of Vermont maple syrup at an additional cost, too. Each Jasper Hill cheese is tastefully wrapped in butcher paper and all of the gift items arrive carefully tucked into a bed of wood shavings, so the aesthetic is appropriately rustic.  12-ounce wedge of Cabot Clothbound (natural-rind, bandaged cheddar), 9-ounce wheel of Harbison (bark-wrapped, soft-ripened bloomy cheese), 12-ounce wedge of Alpha Tolman (raw-milk mountain-style cheese), 5-ounce box of BrewerÉ??s Sea Salt Flatbread, 2.5-ounce bag of SugarbobÉ??s Spiced Pecans (You can add an 8-ounce bottle of Runamok maple syrup for an additional $21.)  dairy, tree nuts, wheat  free in the US for orders $99 and up    gift baskets, which start at $75, are generous and come with ample fixings.

The smallest-size   includes four cheeses, with the option to add on crackers, jam, or dried apricots.

The Portland, OregonÉ??based salumeria uses Old World techniques and Pacific Northwest pork to create its herby, fatty, salty, and utterly delicious charcuterie. Carnivores and food lovers will appreciate the care that goes into every item in this basket. The basket has changed slightly since we first tried it in 2018, but the exquisite sausages remain the same. We particularly enjoyed the spicy chorizo rioja and the zesty, cumin-flavored loukaniko. The smooth and nutty p?õt?? is sumptuous (itÉ??s topped with the traditional layer of fat, which helps preserve the p?õt?? and also makes the whole thing tastier). As for accompaniments, the briny pickled beets help cut the richness of the meats and cheese.

The fresh, runny jams (the seasonal flavor in our box was strawberry rhubarb) were a nice break from chocolate and perfect for dolloping on toast of any kind.

It was a miracle of design that they arrived with nary a crumb out of place. The box itself is a cheerful royal blue, adorned with whimsical drawings of cookies and the people who love them. We found the checkout process to be simple and transparent: When you place an order, a pop-up calendar allows you to choose the day of delivery and shows the respective shipping cost. There is also a clear prompt should you wish to include a card.  two bags of four cookies apiece in assorted flavors (chocolate chip walnut, dark chocolate chocolate chip, chocolate peanut butter chip, and oatmeal raisin)  dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts $12 to $20 for a pack of eight A true lover of baked goods would be thrilled to receive the   box ($64) from   in Portland, Oregon. This seasonal gift box includes a loaf of English-style gingerbread and a dozen chocolate chip cookies made with smoked almonds, salted caramel, and É??really goodÉ?ù chocolate, which came recommended by several members of our staff. We were impressed by how tender-crumbed the gingerbread was, and we enjoyed the traditional flavors of molasses and candied ginger. The cookies were in a class by themselves, crispy on the outside and slightly chewy within; the smoked almonds and grains of salt added a savory complexity that kept us going back for more. Both were packed in beautiful brown boxes with a gold embossed logo and copper tissue paper. The duo is available from mid-November until January, but you can get just the   year-round. Shipping to the West Coast is around $15, while shipping to the East Coast can cost as much as $35. This vibrant mix of seasonal tropical fruit brings a sunny vacation right to a loved oneÉ??s door. If you have family members or friends who love trying new things (or have spent time in tropical locales and miss the produce), the   makes an awesome gift. This is also a great box to buy for yourself to help stave off the winter blues in chillier months. According to its website, Miami Fruit harvests nearly all of its tropical fruit from its own farm and other local farms in Southern Florida every week. The produce changes with the seasons, but each small box (which is the size we tested) contains 3 to 5 pounds of exotic fruit and almost always includes  . When we ordered this box in late September 2020, it included a fresh cacao pod, an avocado, a mamey sapote, a guava, a little jujube, a tree tomato, a few varieties of bananas, and a handful each of passion fruit and key limes. The mamey sapote we received looked and felt like a bald coconut at first, but after two days it became soft and squishy. It tasted like a delightful mix of flan, pumpkin pie, and papaya (minus the strong musk flavor). The fresh cacao pod was also an experience, with beans covered in white flesh that reminded us of mangosteen in flavor but were more wispy and slimy in texture. Even the conventional fruits tasted special: The bananas were more tart and flavorful (not as super sweet as most supermarket bananas tend to be), and the avocado was mildly sweet. All of the fruit comes nestled in a cardboard box with plenty of cushioning, along with directions for accessing online ripening guides so you know exactly when to enjoy each fruit at peak ripeness. This boxÉ??s presentation isnÉ??t fancy, but the fruit is so visually appealing, it makes up for that.  3 to 5 pounds of fruit (small box), varies by season  varies by season $20, or free with code FREE (Note: The California Department of Agriculture restricts the entry of many tropical fruits from Florida. The fruits allowed: bananas, black sapote, passion fruit, jackfruit, and white, red, sunrise, and yellow dragon fruit.)  ItÉ??s a tradition for Wirecutter to send employees a   ($40) from Hawaii every year on their work anniversary, and we always enjoy getting these special, singular fruitsÉ??theyÉ??re the best pineapples weÉ??ve ever tasted. This luxurious gift box showcases a dazzling assortment of chocolates from one of our favorite chocolatiers.  The   from the renowned San Francisco confectioner is an elegantly wrapped, grand display of delicious, handcrafted chocolates. WeÉ??d send this as a formal gift, as well as to pretty much anyone who loves sweets. This box includes a wide array of confections, from bars to truffles to mendiants (chocolate discs), and each group of treats is individually wrapped and placed within a large, beribboned box that looks classy as all get-out. The silky texture and complex flavor of RecchiutiÉ??s chocolate stand apart from the waxiness and cloying sweetness of lesser-quality chocolates weÉ??ve tried, and the judicious use of flavorings enhances (rather than distracts from) its quality. We were most taken with the peanut butter puck (an epicurean version of a ReeseÉ??s Peanut Butter Cup, with a silky, dark milk chocolate shell and velvety filling), and we also enjoyed the rich and satiny caramels. The chocolate bars have perfectly balanced bitter and sweet flavors, and they dissolve on the tongue. The Sharing Box is a great value (though we also recommend the 16-piece Recchiuti Black Box,  ). Plus, the box itself is impressive: Some taste testers said the packaging was a bit austere, but overall we think the embossed box and high-quality materials look sophisticated.  Sepia Collection (one piece each of butterscotch caramel, Piedmont hazelnut, bergamot tea, honeycomb, peanut butter puck, spring jasmine tea, sesame nougat, lavender vanilla, and star anise and pink peppercorn), Cacao Nib and Fleur de Sel Mendiants, Fleur de Sel Caramels, dark hot chocolate, Drag??e Sampler, dark milk bar, semisweet bar, bittersweet bar  milk, peanuts, soy, tree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts), and wheat; made on equipment shared with milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, tree nuts, and wheat  $14 to $30  For truffle lovers, the   ($100) features chocolates with artful garnishes of nuts, fruits, and colorful powders in a delightful assortment of flavors. If you want to spend a bit less (without sacrificing quality) on a smaller yet still lovely and varied assortment of chocolates, go for the   ($85), which also comes with hot chocolate packed in a sleek glass container. Extra-creamy best-selling flavors from a renowned ice cream maker will delight the 6-year-old in just about anyone. When the recipient removes the lid of the unassuming foam box, they will be greeted by appropriately theatrical wisps of dry-ice vapor and the giddy realization that someone has air-mailed them five pints of ice cream. JeniÉ??s, based in Columbus, Ohio, is well known for making extra-creamy frozen treats with fun flavors that are special enough to warrant shipping them around the country. Tasters said they would send this gift for a holiday, a birthday, or a breakup; we think ice cream is a perennially appealing gift.  offers a sampling of the companyÉ??s best pints. We loved the salty-sweet Salted Peanut Butter with Chocolate Flecks, the deeply buttery Salty Caramel, and the tart and refreshing Brambleberry Crisp. We appreciate that the Top Sellers box includes crowd-pleasing yet far-from-boring flavors, but if those flavors donÉ??t speak to you, JeniÉ??s has a   to choose from, including   and   options. (ItÉ??s possible your local specialty supermarket already stocks JeniÉ??s ice cream, but that doesnÉ??t compare to the joy and excitement of receiving ice cream through the mail.) Although the pints ship with dry ice in an insulated carton, make sure the recipient will be home to receive the package so that they donÉ??t end up with tragically inedible ice cream soup. One of our testers, who has ordered this box in the past, said she appreciated being able to schedule delivery in advance to ensure that her parents would be home to receive their ice cream gift (and to confirm that JeniÉ??s delivered to rural New Jersey).

The jams we tested from   are bright and flavorful. WeÉ??re fans of their loose, spreadable consistency, which feels indicative of their freshness, unlike most run-of-the-mill grocery store offerings that are often overcooked and dense. We also like that you get to choose which six jams make up your box. This would make a great gift for breakfast and brunch lovers, and for bakers who enjoy using exceptional jams in their baked goods. The flavors change periodically, and not all those we tried are currently available. But the quality was exceptional across the board. Among our favorites, the blueberry lemon jam stood out because it tasted like a slice of fresh berry pie. Blenheim apricot jam, the   We Love Jam produced, offered a striking and fresh apricot flavor. It was far more nuanced than even the better-quality jams you can find at the store, such as those from Bonne Maman. Vanilla blackberry jam had a mellow sweetness, while raspberry mango passion fruit jam was tart and incredibly balancedÉ??somehow all three flavors shined. We Love JamÉ??s gift box includes six jams of your choosing, but you can also order a box of six jams without the gift packaging for $10 less, or a box of 12 jams. (There is no 12-jar option that comes in gift packaging.) The gift packaging is understated but nice: The jars come neatly packed in a cardboard gift box filled with crinkly shredded paper, and you can include a card with a personal message. The ordering system is a little old school: Before adding the gift box to your shopping cart, you have to type out which flavors youÉ??d like in a text box, referencing a list in the product description. It would be nice if you could just check off the flavors you want instead, but all told the process isnÉ??t that challenging.  six jams (choose from seasonal flavors)  tree nuts  prices vary based on UPS quotes for your order",160,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gift-baskets/,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gift-baskets/

ItÉ??s a clich??, that saying about your spice rack being the most neglected place in your kitchen, where chili powder and nutmeg from 1991 languish. But thereÉ??s truth to it, which is why a batch of vibrant, newly harvested spices in   set could be just the right present for the home cook in your life. You wonÉ??t risk giving the gift of stale seasonings: Printed on the side of each jar is the month and year of the harvest, plus the place of origin and, often, the name of the farm and the farmer, too.

Founded in 1999, Gustiamo is a Bronx-based Italian-American food importer known for sourcing quality ingredients from Italy. It offers a wide selection of beautifully curated gift baskets, but we think the luxurious   box is approachable enough to appeal to most recipients, whether they be clients, colleagues, or family. It has all of the ingredients for putting together a quick pasta dish: a bag of durum wheat semolina pasta, canned San Marzanos tomatoes, crushed Castelvetrano olives that are marinated in herb-infused oil, a large bag of coarse sea salt (not pictured), and a bottle of gorgeous Quinta Luna olive oil. This box also includes a bag of wood-roasted ground coffee and a jar of cacao e nocciole spread, a chocolate and hazelnut confection thatÉ??s like a thoroughbred Nutella and could be enjoyed as a light dessert or breakfast when spread on toast. We wanted to taste the ingredients as simply as possible, so we cooked the pasta al dente and tossed it with an improvised puttanesca-style sauce made with the gift basketÉ??s sweet-tart tomatoes, pungent olives, and aromatic olive oil. The result was outstanding, each best-in-class ingredient pulling its weight. We love that all of these Italian goodies come packaged in a cool-looking reclaimed wooden crateÉ??a detail that makes this gift basket feel even more special. Though this box is one of the more expensive that we recommend, we think the quality of the products and the overall presentation are well worth the investment.

A curious coffee lover will appreciate the   in Rogers, Arkansas. The cleverly packaged sampler contains eight 4-ounce bags of coffee picked by Onyx staff, in varying styles that are sourced globally and roasted to order. The cardboard box they come in looks unassuming but unfurls like a scroll, revealing intricate line drawings and two compartments that contain four bags of coffee each. The beans, packaged in a palette of appealing matte colors, smelled heady upon arrival. On each bag youÉ??ll find the roasting date, the coffeeÉ??s origins, tasting notes, details on how the beans were processed (natural or washed), and where the flavor falls on a scale of É??traditionalÉ?ù (chocolaty, nutty) to É??modernÉ?ù (citrusy, floral). We liked that the coffees represent a range in styles, including single-origin beans and house blends (like cold brew!), and were impressed that the tasting notes were often spot-on. The Costa Rica Las Lajas Natural, which promises hints of blueberry, vanilla, papaya, and Concord grape, tasted so potently of chocolate-covered blueberries that it could convert flavored-coffee drinkers. The 4-ounce bags, which make about four mugs of filtered coffee, are just the right sizeÉ??enough to give a sense of each selection, but not so much that your recipient wonÉ??t be able to use them up while theyÉ??re still fresh. At first glance, the illustrations on the box looked like they might offer brewing instructions, but it was hard for us to make sense of them, leading us to conclude that theyÉ??re more whimsical than anything else. We found the detailed brewing guidance on each coffeeÉ??s individual product page on OnyxÉ??s website to be most helpful. ThereÉ??s also an option to leave a gift note at checkout.  eight 4-ounce bags of coffee selected by the roaster free for orders over $50  Another great option for coffee nerds and everyday drinkers alike, the   ($52) includes four 8-ounce bags of just-roasted whole beans from the Portland, Oregon, roaster (the same quantity as the Onyx sampler but half the variety). The beans change seasonally, and you can choose between two flavor-driven options when ordering: One set is É??for those who want a rich cup,É?ù and the other is for those who prefer a fruity or floral cup. Each batch we brewed exhibited the best characteristics of É?? É?ù coffee: clean, distinguishable flavors (like a fine wine) that emphasize the beanÉ??s unique terroir. Tea lovers will appreciate this collection of Harney & SonsÉ??s high-quality, best-selling teas. *At the time of publishing, the price was  $35 . This set includes the same selection of teas as in the Harney & Sons best-selling sachets box, but in loose-leaf form.  If you have a tea lover in your life, you probably canÉ??t go wrong by giving them a selection of teas from family-owned Harney & Sons. Its   collection (which we tried as sachets but is also available in  ) features four crowd-pleasing, high-quality teas: English Breakfast, Earl Grey Supreme, Paris, and Hot Cinnamon Spice. The English Breakfast tea was bright and clean, and the Earl Grey (a blend of black and oolong teas with Italian bergamot oil) was pleasantly aromatic. The Paris blend was tea-forward, with subtle hints of black currant and vanilla. And the Hot Cinnamon Spice was sweet and cinnamony, but somehow still allowed the natural tea flavor to shine through. One of our testers, whoÉ??s averse to flavored teas, said, É??This was easily the most enjoyable version of cinnamon tea IÉ??ve encountered.É?ù Each of the four teas comes packaged in a colorful tin of 20 sachets. The tins fit snugly in an elegant black box with the Harney & Sons logo embossed on the lid.
