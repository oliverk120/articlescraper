When you live on your own, you have to start figuring out how to fix things yourself. That's where YouTube comes in. But repairs, both minor and major, call for the right tools.

They can use the gift card to treat themselves to something on their wishlist or to buy apartment necessities. You can choose how much money to put on the gift card, then then have it delivered electronically.

Cold, hard cash is what most new graduates want, even if they won't come right out and say it. Visa gift cards can be used in stores and online (unlike cash), and you can preload them with whatever amount you want. You can even customize the card or send one virtually, and the recipient can keep refilling the card if they want to.

Featuring a built-in clock and calendar, this slim digital picture frame can display Mom's favorite memories in a rotating slideshow (via SD memory card or USB). It'll come in real handy if she's starting to run out of room on her phone, and you and your siblings won't be able to fight over who gets the primo spot on her gallery wall anymore — a win-win.

Homesick creates custom candles inspired by specific states and cities (including some college towns) — Austin smells like bergamot, amber, and ""warm Texas suede,"" for example. Find the one that corresponds to your new stomping grounds, and Mom will think of you every time she lights it. If you have a little wiggle room in your budget, you can add a personalized note for $15 more.

A friend with a five-month-old told us Teleties' bendable, non-slip claw clips are great for moms with little ones who like to grab and tug on long hair. They're a little pricier than standard hair clips (ranging from $8.99 to $14.99, depending on the size), so she probably wouldn't think to splurge on them herself. Choose from three sizes and seven colors.

We know that a recent college grad has been carrying a backpack for most of her life, but this is the perfect time to upgrade to a more professional style. Depending on the line of work your grad is going into, she might need a good, put-together bag. This one comes in three color options.

If the grad has a bunch of senior photos she doesn't know what to do with, pop them into a photo book. This is a great, thoughtful way to display all those photos that might otherwise be lost to a Facebook album. Plus, you can write captions and sentimental notes throughout the book.

Similar to a photo book, this one pulls at the heartstrings a bit. It's a box filled with letters and photos all dedicated to the graduate. You can gift this alone or have collaborators work on it with you to give the grad a special keepsake box of memories.

After four years of campus food and ramen, treat the grad to some restaurant food. Okay, she's definitely eaten out at some point in the last four years, but it's still nice to have a reason to eat at a restaurant. And adult life doesn't come with a meal plan.

This also gives her more freedom to attend different types of fitness classes around her city. Speaking of cities, ClassPass isn't available everywhere, so make sure your grad's location is on the participating list.

Cast iron skillets are the versatile workhorses of any kitchen — they retain heat tremendously well and can be used for almost any dish, from steak to skillet cookies. (They're also durable enough to be used over a campfire, if your recipient's into that.)

It's available in six colors, including Cerise (pictured), Artichaut, Caribbean, Marseille, Oyster, and White.

Designed to make the perfect cup of joe at the molecular level, this Borosilicate glass brewing device is simple to use and&nbsp;allows coffee to be covered and refrigerated for reheating (without losing any of its bold flavor).

Amazon's latest Fire TV Stick is its most powerful (and speediest) media player yet, with Dolby Atmos and&nbsp;Vision support on top of HDR, HDR10+, and WiFi 6 compatibility. (Jeff Bezos and friends have also thrown in a nice new Alexa Voice Remote with dedicated buttons for popular streaming services.) If your date nights frequently involve Netflix and chillin', grab one on sale come Black Friday for gifting.

If your boyfriend is just too lazy to look outside when someone knocks on his front door (*raises hand*), how about a video doorbell? The wired (read: more affordable) version of the Alexa-enabled Arlo Essential Video Doorbell can be installed easily using his existing doorbell's wiring — no need to call in a pro. Plus, it's got two-way audio, motion detection, and crystal-clear HD video so he never misses an Amazon package.

Subscribers get unlimited access to thousands of titles and podcasts; you can upgrade him to Audible Plus Premium for a once-a-month credit that's good toward any audiobook he wants, which will be his to keep forever.

Just have him connect the Pill+ to a laptop or smartphone via Bluetooth, and he's all set to pump some jams.

It could be said that there are two types of people: Those who wake up and get out of bed at the time they planned to, and those who idealistically set an alarm and then hit ""snooze"" until the absolute last possible moment, thus repeatedly waking the person they are next to. If your boyfriend is a ""snoozer,"" we offer our apologies and this gift idea for you both: a smart vibrating alarm clock that goes under his pillow, which he can snooze on to his heart's content without loudly waking you.

You love her. She loves her plant collection. It works out. This hip gift is the Hoya Kerrii Plant, nicknamed the Hoya Heart due to its heart-shaped leaves. The waxy plant feels like a succulent and is potted in a tiny, precious two-inch pot. It only needs to be watered every three to four weeks and is pet-friendly.

Whether she's sore from leg day or has an achy back due to chronic pain, introducing her to a percussion therapy gun is the next best thing to taking her for a daily deep-tissue massage. These devices beat deep into muscles to repair fibers and enhance blood flow, both of which are crucial in relieving pain and for post-workout recovery. The Hyperice Hypervolt is currently one of the best and quietest on the market.

Finding better ways to play isn’t just limited to game design, but also hardware. Sure, the wireless controller that comes with the Xbox Series X/S already works great, but you can’t fine-tune its settings or change out any components if you’re unhappy with it. Enter: the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, a premium controller your gamer friend can customize to their liking. It's got adjustable resistance and hair-trigger lock settings; swappable thumbsticks and paddle shapes; and remappable buttons — plus, they can save up to three different profiles.

This large-and-in-change Sony console also nudges players closer to the cutting-edge PC experience, said Mashable's Adam Rosenberg. Much-improved load times give it a zippier feel than previous generations, and there are two graphical modes for a smidge of customization, which is neat. (""Fidelity"" gets you ray tracing, 4K output, and 30fps, while ""Performance"" swaps that for 60fps with less impressive visuals.) The new DualSense controller it comes with is a huge draw itself — PCMag straight-up called it ""revolutionary.""

Even if your girlfriend isn't into makeup, a Sephora gift card is still a good gift idea. The beauty retailer doesn't just stock cosmetics, but also skincare, haircare, beauty tools, and fragrances. Get your girlfriend store credit for any amount you want, set her free in Sephora, and voilà.

This book lays out specific, actionable steps people can take to develop the skills to practice and nurture love better than ever before. Inspired by Vedic wisdom and modern science, the book covers all aspects of the relationship cycle — from budding romance to getting over a breakup.

Equally appropriate for both the gym and the Saturday morning soccer field, the pants taper slightly at the ankle for a more modern silhouette. He can feel good about wearing them too, as they're made of 40% recycled material, including ocean plastic.
