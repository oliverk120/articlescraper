Plus, it's easier than ever: There are dozens of online flower delivery services out there offering unique fresh bouquets, trendy dried flower arrangements, and even floral subscriptions. While our staff has used nearly every one of these merchants to send loved ones flowers over the years, we wanted to know exactly how they stack up against one another. We ordered 39 arrangements from 16 popular brands, sending the flowers to Insider Reviews team members all over the country. Our goal was to find a service that delivers the freshest, most attractive flowers that arrive on time — no matter your location. UrbanStems makes some of the most stunning bouquets we've found and offers something for everyone, with a diverse selection of fresh flowers, dried flowers, plants, gifts, and subscriptions. Farmgirl Flowers offers unique and playful arrangements that change with what's in season and with many blooms sourced from California farmers. Floracracy's custom arrangements are a unique way to mark life's meaningful moments and make gifting flowers feel incredibly personal and special.  FTD offers hundreds of bouquets, gifts, and plants for delivery in all 50 states and 150 counties, with many options for same-day arrival.   BloomsyBox offers a la carte bouquets and plants, but its wide variety of subscription plans are where the service really shines. Preserved roses are incredibly popular and can last more than a year with proper care. We love Rosebox for preserved roses because of its robust selection of arrangements, vases, and colors. As the name implies, Roses Only sells just one product, but it does it remarkably well, delivering some of the most pristine, stunning, long-stemmed roses we've ever seen. Fresh flowers have a short lifespan, but dried florals from East Olivia can last for years with proper care — and feature inventive colors and textures not found in traditional fresh bouquets.",2023-02-09T23:46:24Z,,https://www.businessinsider.com

We recently tackled this issue by sending 27 bouquets from 12 popular flower delivery services to 10 testers all over the country for our guide to the  . We've long been big fans of UrbanStems, but we really put the service to the test for this guide, sending bouquets, plants, and dried flowers to New York City, Boston, and rural Colorado. This was a big task for UrbanStems since our Colorado-based tester reports that most flower services don't deliver to her small town, and if they do, the flowers usually arrive late or in bad shape from the long journey down unpaved roads.  Despite the challenge we posed, UrbanStems delivered some of the freshest, most attractive bouquets to all our testers — on time and in excellent condition. All the arrangements were bright and lively, with creative blooms in a range of color palettes. For this reason, it earned the top spot as our best overall pick for flower delivery service. Here's what we love about UrbanStems. When you head over to the UrbanStems website, you'll find a fantastic product selection spanning everything from fresh bouquets, dried flowers, gifts, plants, and subscriptions. All of the flowers and plants are sourced from sustainable farms, with which UrbanStems' in-house  . With prices that start at $45, UrbanStems is a relatively affordable option as well.   website was also very easy to navigate. Filters allow you to sort by product type, occasion, price, color, and collection. When you navigate to the product page, it tells you exactly what flowers are in the bouquet (a must if you have pets at home for whom plants could be toxic) and the recommended occasion. Once you've picked  , put in your desired delivery address and choose from the delivery date options listed. UrbanStems provides a calendar that shows which delivery dates are available, as well as notes when the bouquet will be back in stock if it is sold out. UrbanStems also suggests vases that complement each bouquet, should you want to spend a little extra to send a vase as well.  Moving to checkout is simple. UrbanStems has you sign up with your email so they can inform you of the status of your order. Then all you have to do is fill out the delivery information and a cute note to go with your flowers. If you're stumped, UrbanStems has some sweet prewritten options for you, but you can completely customize this part on your own. If you live in New York City or Washington, D.C., you can receive same-day delivery on some bouquets. Otherwise, many products are available for next-day delivery to the lower 48 states, though you'll have more options if you choose a delivery date at least a few days out.  Our three testers all had a different experience with delivery options. Our New York City tester was able to quickly arrange next-day delivery for her   bouquet, while our tester out in rural Colorado had to choose a date a little over a week out for her  . Despite having more limited delivery dates depending on location, all our blooms arrived on the day the company said they would.  Our testers took the opportunity to sample a wide arrange of products from  . Between the three of us, we ordered  , a blend of bright orange and pink roses with spots of muted blue delphinium; the  , which features curvy veronica flowers and snapdragons in cool shades of purple and blue; and  , a lush arrangement of roses and carnations in shades of pink. We also ordered   from UrbanStems' collection of   and   from its selection of  .  Just browsing the site was a fun experience for each of us. The arrangements are modern, playful, and gorgeous, and we each oo-ed and ah-ed at each other's selections. All of the products arrived on time in colorful pink boxes that built excitement. The bouquets were lush, vibrant, and lively. Our Colorado tester was particularly impressed with the quality of the blooms since she's had bad experiences with flower delivery before. The   dried bouquet was gorgeous, albeit a bit stiff compared to bouquets from our  . My   arrangement was a bit more purple-y pink than the pictures on the site showed, but some variation is to be expected with fresh flowers, and the bouquet was still bright, vibrant, and full. All the bouquets arrived with some closed buds; however, this is fairly normal, and they eventually opened up after a couple of days. The flowers lasted a little over a week — average for fresh-cut flowers, though a few days shorter than some of the other services we tested.  After testing 12 flower delivery services, we think UrbanStems is your best bet. However, it might not be the right choice for every situation. If you need to send flowers the same day or to locations further afield than the lower 48 states, you may prefer a service like  , which uses local florists and offers services in all 50 states and 150 countries. If you're specifically looking for preserved or fresh roses, we recommend   and  , respectively, for best results. UrbanStems is our top choice for flower delivery service for its robust selection, flexible delivery dates, and beautiful blooms. We love that it delivers flowers on time and in great condition to even more remote corners of the lower 48 states. If you're looking to gift flowers that your recipient will remember, UrbanStems is the best option. ",2022-05-06T17:43:16Z,,https://www.businessinsider.com
